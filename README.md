This repository contains code for an automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline for supervised learning. The pipeline is implemented from scratch using Python and the scikit-learn library.

Overview
The pipeline first performs a feature selection step to identify the most important features in the dataset. It then trains a variety of machine learning models on the selected features, and selects the best model based on a variety of criteria.

The pipeline is designed to be easy to use and to be able to be used on a variety of datasets. It is also designed to be efficient, so that it can be used to train models on large datasets.

Features
The pipeline can be used to train models for a variety of supervised learning tasks, including classification and regression.
The pipeline can be used to train models on a variety of datasets, including both categorical and numerical features.
The pipeline is easy to use and can be used by beginners and experienced users alike.
Benefits
The pipeline can save you time and effort by automating the machine learning process.
The pipeline can help you to improve the accuracy of your models.
The pipeline can help you to identify the most important features in your dataset.
Usage
To use the pipeline, you first need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can then clone the repository and run the main.py script. The script will guide you through the process of training a model.
